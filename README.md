# Description

A template for C++ projects using CI, Building, Testing, Formatting, Documenting and more
Aimed to use starting point with a big number of features with easy way to include or exclude a feature.

This is my POV on such a type of template, thus you might disagree with what I use and how I do things.
And any feedback is really appreciated!
